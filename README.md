# Polygon snake
Basic snakegame written in C. I made this for fun and for learning math && algorithms behind polygons. It is work in progress and it probably will never be finished due to the fact that it is not gonna blow up indie game markets :).

### Building
At the moment this depends on [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) so compile && install it first.
```
./build.sh
```
run the game:
```
./snakegame
```
run the editor
```
./editor
```

### about editor
You can draw walls by clicking and save level.lvl by pressing s. 
## TODO:
- editor: GUI elements
- editor: Snakes startposition && angle
- editor: Wall deletion
- editor: Helpers for wallcreation
- game: powerups. Wall smashing && stuff
- game: gameover animation
- game: teleports
- game: Max Payne style slowmotion mode && wolfenstein 3d view
- etc etc etc
